# HoverCard

<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/hovercard" target="_blank">**Hover cards**</a> show commands and information, such as metadata and activity, when someone hovers over an item.

**Hover cards are not accessible to anyone not using a mouse with hover capability**. It is strongly suggested that any information or functionality available in the hover card is also easily accessible through another means.
