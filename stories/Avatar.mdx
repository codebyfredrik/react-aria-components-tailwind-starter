# Avatar
 
An avatar is a thumbnail representation of an entity, such as a user or an organization.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.BasicExample} />

## Round avatar

Use `rounded-full` utility to render a rounded avatar.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.RoundedAvatars} />


## Avatar sizes

Use the `size-*` utility to render avatars in different sizes. The default size is **size-10**.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.AvatarSizes} />

### Initial fallback

The `alt` prop is used to generate initial avatar when image src is not available.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.InitialFallbacks} />

### Icon fallback

Use the `fallback="icon"` to show a placeholder avatar icon when image src not available.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.IconFallbacks} />


### Colorful

An avatar can have the color be automatically picked based on the `alt` prop.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.Colorful} />

### Avatar badges

Use the `AvatarBadge` component to add badges. Badges are positioned at the bottom right corner of the avatar. Badge icon should be wrapped within the `Icon` component and include an `aria-label` for accessibility.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.AvatarBadges} />

### Avatar badge sizes

Badge sizes are automatically scaled based on the avatar size.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.AvatarBadgeSizes} />

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.StyleAvatarBadge} />
